# rock_paper_scissors
This is a virtual rock paper and scissors game using Python.
Rock-paper-scissors is a simple hand game played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:
- Rock (a fist)
- Paper (an open hand)
- Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

The game has three possible outcomes:
- Rock crushes scissors
- Scissors cuts paper
- Paper covers rock

If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie. The game is often used as a playful decision-making tool or to settle disputes in a fun way.
